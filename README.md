## About me

I am not a serious modder.
I created the Image Screens mod because I wanted to learn Unreal Engine.

I am a professional game developer and I tried to document the mods well,
so that they can be used as a learning material.
The mods contain programming documentation which explains how each mod is made,
why some features are implemented the way they are, etc.

I am not too active in the Satisfactory modding discord.
My Discord username is `michal.rehacek`.
However, the best way to reach me is my email: rehacek AT the mail from google.
If you want to report a problem with the mod, you can use the Github issues page or email.
